= Configuring Client Tools

After the client tools are installed, they must be configured. The easiest method of configuring the client tools is to use the interactive setup wizard, which walks you through the configuration steps by asking several questions. 


[IMPORTANT]
====
You must run the interactive setup wizard after installing the client tools so that your workstation is correctly configured to communicate with the remote OpenShift server. 
====

The following is a sample walk through of the setup wizard, and some general information to assist you with the initial configuration. It assumes you have installed the latest version of the client tools. Use +rhc --version+ to verify the installed version, or link:updating_client_tools.html[update the client tools].


[NOTE]
====
The following setup wizard example was run on Windows 7. Screen outputs may vary depending on the operating system. 
====


*Starting the Setup Wizard*

Launch the setup wizard:

----
$ rhc setup
OpenShift Client Tools (RHC) Setup Wizard

This wizard will help you upload your SSH keys, set your application namespace, and check that other programs like Git are properly installed.
----

*Login Information*

The setup wizard next prompts you for the login credentials that were used to sign up for an OpenShift account. Alternatively, you can also use your Red Hat login credentials.

----
Login to openshift.redhat.com: user@example.com
Password: password
----

*Authorization Tokens*

You are then prompted to generate an authorization token. Answering [userinput]#yes# stores a token in your home directory to be used on subsequent requests. When it expires, you are prompted for your password again. 

----
OpenShift can create and store a token on disk which allows to you to access the server without using your password. The key is stored in your home directory and should be kept secret. You can delete the key at any time by running 'rhc logout'.
Generate a token now? (yes|no) yes
Generating an authorization token for this client ... lasts about 1 day
----

*Configuration File*

With your login credentials, the setup wizard creates the [filename]#express.conf# configuration file in your home directory. In the following example, the [filename]#express.conf# file is created in the [filename]#C:\Users\User1\.openshift# directory.

----
Saving configuration to C:\Users\User1\.openshift\express.conf ... done
----

*SSH Keys*

Next, the setup wizard configures the SSH keys so that your system can authenticate with the remote server. Because this is the initial configuration, it is assumed no existing SSH keys are found on your system. Therefore, the setup wizard generates a new pair of SSH keys, named [filename]#id_rsa# and [filename]#id_rsa.pub#, and saves them in your home directory. In the following example the SSH keys are generated and saved in the [filename]#C:\Users\User1\.ssh# directory.

----
No SSH keys were found. We will generate a pair of keys for you.
Created: C:\Users\User1\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
----

After the new SSH keys are generated, the public key, [filename]#id_rsa.pub#, must be uploaded to the OpenShift server to authenticate your system to the remote server. Enter a name to use for your key, or leave it blank to use the default name. In the following example the default name is used.

----
Your public ssh key must be uploaded to the OpenShift server to access code.
Upload now? (yes|no) yes

Since you do not have any keys associated with your OpenShift account, your new key will be uploaded as the 'default' key

Uploading key 'default' from C:\Users\User1\.ssh\id_rsa.pub ... done
----

*Installed Software*

The setup wizard verifies if Git version control software is installed on your system. Git is required to create and deploy applications to the OpenShift cloud environment. It is assumed that all the required software for your operating system is already installed as described in the earlier sections of this document. In the example below, the setup wizard verifies that Git for Windows is installed correctly.

----
In order to fully interact with RedBridge Apps you will need to install and configure a git client if you have not already done so.
Documentation for installing other tools you will need for RedBridge Apps can be found on the OpenShift Online page at https://openshift.redhat.com/community/developers/install-the-client-tools

We recommend these free applications:

* Git for Windows - a basic git command line and GUI client https://github.com
/msysgit/msysgit/wiki/InstallMSysGit

* TortoiseGit - git client that integrates into the file explorer http://code.

----

*Domain*

The setup wizard next verifies whether a domain already exists for your cloud environment. The example below assumes that a domain does not exist, and one must be created. If you did create a domain when you signed up for an OpenShift account, it is displayed here. To create a domain at this time, enter the desired name when prompted. Alternatively, you can create a domain using the OpenShift Management Console, or with the +rhc domain create+ command later. The domain named _MyDomain_ is created in the following example.

----
Checking for a domain ... none

Your domain is unique to your account and is the suffix of the public URLs we assign to your applications. You may configure your domain here or leave it blank and use 'rhc domain create' to create a domain later. You will not be able to create applications without first creating a domain.

Please enter a domain (letters and numbers only) |<none>|: MyDomain
Your domain name 'MyDomain' has been successfully created
----

IMPORTANT: A domain must be created before you can create RedBridge Apps applications.

*Applications*

Finally, the setup wizard verifies whether any applications exist under your domain. Any applications created with the Management Console are displayed here. In the example below, no applications have been created. In this case the setup wizard shows the types of applications that can be created with the associated commands. The setup wizard then completes by displaying the current gear consumption along with the gear sizes available to the given user.

Run 'rhc app create' to create your first application.
